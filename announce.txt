The following packages have been updated in the Cygwin distribution:

* clisp-2.49-1

* clisp-clx-2.49-1 (32-bit only)
* clisp-gdi-2.49-1 (32-bit only)
* clisp-gtk2-2.49-1 (32-bit only)

ANSI Common Lisp is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.  GNU CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible of Karlsruhe University and Michael Stoll of Munich University, both in Germany.  It mostly supports the Lisp described in the ANSI Common Lisp standard.  GNU CLISP includes an interpreter, a compiler, a debugger, CLOS, MOP, a foreign language interface, sockets, i18n, fast bignums, and more.  An X11 interface is available through CLX, Garnet, CLUE/CLIO.  GNU CLISP runs Maxima, ACL2, and many other Common Lisp packages.

This is an update to the latest upstream release.  The 32-bit binary was built with the following add-on modules: rawsock, dirkey, wildcards, bindings/win32, berkeley-db, zlib, pcre, fastcgi, postgresql, libsvm, and gdbm.  The 64-bit binary was built with only rawsock and dirkey; moreover, it was built *without* the regexp module, which is normally part of every clisp build.[*]

[*] The attempted build of regexp fails because of a gcc problem:

       https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=64939

The same sort of error occurs with several other modules.  In addition, some modules require ffcall, which has not yet been ported to 64-bit Cygwin.
