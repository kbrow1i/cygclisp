The following package has been added to the 64-bit Cygwin distribution:

* clisp-2.48-4

ANSI Common Lisp is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.  GNU CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible of Karlsruhe University and Michael Stoll of Munich University, both in Germany.  It mostly supports the Lisp described in the ANSI Common Lisp standard.  GNU CLISP includes an interpreter, a compiler, a debugger, CLOS, MOP, a foreign language interface, sockets, i18n, fast bignums, and more.  GNU CLISP runs Maxima, ACL2, and many other Common Lisp packages.

This is the first release of clisp for 64-bit Cygwin.  It is built with no non-default modules, and with the default regexp module disabled.  I had to do the latter because of a gcc problem I encountered while trying to compile regexp:

   https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=64939

The same sort of error occurs with several other modules.  I hope to be able to release a more complete clisp once this problem is solved.

As I said in my recent announcement of 32-bit clisp-2.48-4, I am not a clisp user, so I can't properly support it.  But I did run the supplied testsuite on the 64-bit build, and it passed all but 3 of about 11,000 tests.  So I hope it will be usable.  Feedback is welcome.
